Often I am given a subnet when having the individual IP addresses would be better, depending on what the type of engagement is and what tools I'm planning to use. 

This tool is designed to address the situation where I want to convert a valid subnet into individual IP addresses, but don't want to fuss with manually recording them.

It takes as input, either a single subnet with the '-s' flag, or an input file via the '-if' flag and writes the individual IP addresses to stdout.

Optionally, it can also write the individual IP addresses to an output file via the '-of' flag. 

Also optionally, it can omit the subnet IDs and broadcast IDs via the -o flag. The '-d' flag is used to debug CLI arguments and a few other odds and ends.
